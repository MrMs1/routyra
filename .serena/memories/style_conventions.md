# Style and conventions

- Language: Swift, using SwiftUI and SwiftData.
- Naming: standard Swift camelCase for vars/methods, UpperCamelCase for types; `// MARK:` sections used in several files.
- No explicit lint/format config found (no SwiftLint config in repo).
- UI strings are currently hard-coded in many views; Localizable resources exist but not wired yet (see localization notes).
